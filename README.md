# generative-uap

For Fall 2019, I took the Big Data Analytics course at Columbia University (EECS E6893). My project focused on trying to find a generative algorithm for creating universal adversarial perturbations (Inspired by the original UAP paper: ([Universal Adversarial Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08401))

Current algorithms for generating universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) have dependencies on a training set and/or a model and can take a very long time to generate. The goal of this project was to create a generative uap algorithm that is completely independent of both data (a training set) and models.

The algorithm is based analysis of UAPs generated from [source code from the athors of the UAP paper](https://github.com/LTS4/universal) and two observations:
1) Deep neural networks are able to acheive very complex and organic functions by composing very simple functions (e.g. ReLU)
2) Convolution is a central concept for image classification models

The algorithm is very simple: we iteratively apply a random convolution to a random (padded) seed UAP and saturate the output (negative numbers -> -10 and positive numbers -> 10). 

Using the inceptionh5 model and the ILSVRC2012 validation dataset, 50 UAPs generated with this algorithm acheived an average fooling rate of 44.75%. Contrast this with an average fooling rate of 52.33% for the approach used in the original UAP paper (averaging results over UAPS tested against datasets they were not trained on). 

Below is a GIF that shows the evolution of the UAP over convolution iterations

Below are 224 x 224 sample UAPs generated with the algorithm
